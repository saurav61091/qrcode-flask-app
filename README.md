# Flask QR Code Generator and File Access App

This Flask application provides a secure way to generate QR codes for files and manage secure file access through authenticated endpoints. It uses basic HTTP authentication for user verification and generates QR codes that link to secure, token-based file retrieval endpoints.

## Features

- **Basic HTTP Authentication:** Secure endpoints using username and password.
- **QR Code Generation:** Generate QR codes embedding URLs for secure file access.
- **Secure File Access:** Serve files securely based on valid tokens and prevent reuse of tokens.

## Installation

Before running the application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the required Python packages.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url-here
cd your-app
Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configuration
Modify the instance/config.py file to set up environment-specific variables such as the secret key and database URI (if applicable).
python
# instance/config.py
SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key-here'
Running the Application
To run the application, use the following command:
bash
python run.py
This will start the Flask development server, and you should see output indicating that the server is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Usage
Authentication
Endpoints are protected with HTTP Basic Authentication. Default user credentials are set in the auth.py file and should be updated before deployment.
Generating QR Codes
To generate a QR code for a file, use the /generate/<filename> endpoint:
bash
curl -u username:password http://127.0.0.1:5000/generate/example.pdf
This will return a JSON response with a link to the generated QR code.
Accessing Files
To access a file via a QR code, scan the code with a QR scanner, which will direct you to a URL requiring authentication. Once authenticated, the file will be downloaded if a valid token is provided.
